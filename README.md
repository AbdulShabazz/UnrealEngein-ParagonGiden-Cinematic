# UnrealEngine-ParagonGideon-Cinematic
A Third Person Character Unreal Engine Level Developed in Blueprints.

**Note:**

This project requires a third-party `/Content/ParagonGideon` project folder to house the **Paragon Gideon Character Project**, found on **Fab dot com**.

Due to a config error in .gitignore, any changes to the main character blueprint, ParagonGideon.uasset, are **not saved** during commits.
