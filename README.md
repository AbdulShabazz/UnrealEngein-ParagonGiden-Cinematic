# UnrealEngine-ParagonGiden-Cinematic
A Third Person Character Unreal Engine Level Developed in Blueprints.

**Note:**

This project requires a third-party `/Content/ParagonGideon` project folder to house the **Paragon Gideon Character Project**, found on **Fab dot com**.

Due to an open config error in my .gitignore, changes to ParagonGideon.uasset are **not saved** during commits.
