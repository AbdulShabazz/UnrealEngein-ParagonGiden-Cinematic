# UnrealEngine-ParagonGideon-Cinematic
A Third Person Character Unreal Engine Level Developed in Blueprints which also records player camera transforms (ie. location + rotation) for replay in cinematics.

**Note:**

This project requires a third-party `/Content/ParagonGideon` project folder to support the **Paragon Gideon Character Project**, found on **Fab dot com**. (Due to a config error in .gitignore, changes to the main character blueprint, ParagonGideon.uasset, are **not saved** during regular commits).
