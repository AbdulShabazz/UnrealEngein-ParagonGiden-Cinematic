# Blueprint Interface assets

**Note**: BPI_FollowCamera and BPI_SpringArmConponent are interfaces used to relay Player camera transforms, which are usually not recorded in Sequencer / Take Recorder, to a custom cinema camera blueprint, BP_CinematicCamera, so transforms can be recorded and copied back, in Sequencer.
